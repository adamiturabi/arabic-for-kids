# "with", "above", and "under"

### "with" {-}

The word for "with" in Arabic is [ب]{.ar}.

[ب]{.ar} comes before a word and is joined to it. For example:

[كُرَة]{.ar}  
"a ball"

[بِكُرَة]{.ar}  
"with a ball"

If a word has [ال]{.ar} then [ب]{.ar} is joined to the [ال]{.ar}.

[الكُرَة]{.ar}  
"a ball"

[بِالكُرَة]{.ar}  
"with a ball"

[ب]{.ar} is joined to the [ال]{.ar}.When [ب]{.ar} is joined to [ال]{.ar}, we don't pronounce the [ا]{.ar} in [ال]{.ar}

[بِالكُرَة]{.ar} is pronounced [bil-kurah]{.trn}.

We can use [ب]{.ar} in a sentence:

[لَعِبَ زَيْد بِالكُرَة الصَّغِيرَة]{.ar}  
"Zayd played with the small ball."

### "above" and "under" {-}

The word for above is [فَوْقَ]{.ar}.

[فَوْقَ الشَّجَرَة]{.ar}  
"above the tree."

Similarly, the word for under is [تَحْتَ]{.ar}.

[تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَة]{.ar}  
"under the tree."
