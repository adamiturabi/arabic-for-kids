# That

Last time we learned two words for "this":

1. [هَـٰذَا]{.ar} for boys or if the noun does not have [ة]{.ar}.
2. [هَـٰذِهِ]{.ar} for girls or if the noun has [ة]{.ar}.

Today, in-shaa-Allah we will learn how to say "that":

1. [ذَ ٰلِكَ]{.ar} for boys or if the noun does not have [ة]{.ar}.
2. [تِلْكَ]{.ar} for girls or if the noun has [ة]{.ar}.

[مَا ذَ ٰلِكَ؟ ذَ ٰلِكَ كَلْب]{.ar}  
"What is that? That is a dog."

[مَا تِلْكَ؟ تِلْكَ شَجَرَة]{.ar}  
"What is that? That is a tree."

[مَنْ ذَ ٰلِكَ؟ ذَ ٰلِكَ رَجُل]{.ar}  
"Who is that? That is a man."

[مَنْ تِلْكَ؟ تِلْكَ بِنْت]{.ar}  
"Who is that? That is a girl."
