# Prepositions

## Instruction

Prepositions are words like "to", "in", "on", "from".

Here are some Arabic prepositions

| Arabic | English |
|:----------------|:---------|
|[إِلَىٰ]{.ar} [ilA]{.trn}  | to |
|[فِي]{.ar}  [fI]{.trn}   | in |
|[عَلَىٰ]{.ar} [ealA]{.trn} | on |
|[مِنْ]{.ar}  [min]{.trn}  | from |

Note that [إِلَىٰ]{.ar} and [عَلَىٰ]{.ar} end with [ىٰ]{.ar}: a [yaa]{.trn} with no dots and with a tiny [alif]{.trn} on top of it. This is pronounced like an [alif]{.trn}.

Prepositions come before nouns just like in English. Examples:

[إِلَىٰ المَسْجِد]{.ar}  
"to the masjid"

[فِي بَيْت]{.ar}  
"in a house"

[عَلَىٰ كِتَاب]{.ar}  
"on a book"

[مِنْ الوَلَد]{.ar}  
"from the boy"
