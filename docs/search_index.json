This is a work in progress and is currently incomplete. The development page is at: https://github.com/adamiturabi/arabic-for-kids Approach We will focus on basic grammar, vocabulary and comprehension. So for example, we will accept as correct: فَتَحَ الوَلَد بَاب وَذَهَبَ إِلَىٰ الحَديقَة fataḥa ʾal-walad baab wadhahaba ʾilaa ʾal-ḥadeeqah rather than فَتَحَ الوَلَدُ بَابًا وَذَهَبَ إِلَى الحَديقَة fataḥa l-waladu baaban wadhahaba ʾila l-ḥadeeqah The reason for this is that our goal is for children to be able to parse sentences and read and write at a basic proficiency. Although case endings are essential for an in-depth understanding, and indeed for disambiguation from flexible word order (ضَرَبَ عمرًا زيدٌ), we feel they are not imperative to understand sentences that follow normal word order. At this basic level, we fear that case endings will introduce additional complexity to a non-native speaking student. Once the student is at a high-school or college level, they may take an الآجرومية or similar course for a more complete study of the grammar. We will however try to introduce the concept of inflection to the student. Perhaps the sound masculine plural inflection in the marfooɛ vs other cases will be suitable for this since it is one of the more visible inflections in unvowelized text and the student will get accustomed to seeing it in his supplemental reading. Starting age Lesson 1 of this course should be suitable for a child of around 8 years of age. Pre-requisites The student should already know how to read fully vowelized Arabic at a beginner level, i.e., basic fathah, kasrah, ḍammah, shaddah, and long vowels. More complicated orthography, like hamzat al-wasl, is not expected to be known. But it is assumed that the student is getting Quranic tajweed instruction at the same time elsewhere. Instruction and drills Each lesson is to be instructed to the student with new vocabulary introduced. This lesson is then reinforced by regular drills. The drills usually require the student to translate a few sentences from Arabic to English and English to Arabic. "],["nouns.html", "1 Nouns 1.1 Vocabulary Drill 1 Answer key for drill 1 Drill 2 Answer key for drill 2", " 1 Nouns Nouns are words for people, animals, places or things. Here is an example of a noun: “a boy”. In Arabic, “a boy” is وَلَد. Note that in وَلَد, the و and ل have a fatḥah but د does not have any mark on it. For now, we will pretend that there is a sukoon on د so we will pronounce the word as walad. Here are some more Arabic nouns: English Arabic a boy وَلَد walad a lion أَسَد asad a house بَيْت bayt a book كِتَاب kitaab In English we can say “a boy” or “the boy”. Arabic does not have a word for “a” but it does have a word for “the”. The word for “the” in Arabic is اَلْ al. اَلْ is joined to the noun. So “the boy” is اَلْوَلَد “al-walad”. If an Arabic noun does not have اَلْ joined to it then in English we will say the noun with “a”. اَلْوَلَد “the boy” وَلَد “a boy” Here are the nouns we saw earlier, with اَلْ: Arabic English اَلْوَلَد al-walad the boy اَلْأَسَد al-asad the lion اَلْبَيْت al-bayt the house اَلْكِتَاب al-kitaab the book NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR It seems better to me to leave out الحروف الشمسية والقمرية for now. It should be okay if the student pronounces الدراجة as al-darraajah instead of ad-darraajah. In-shaa-Allah he will become familiar with the correct pronunciation when he reads it fully vowellized الدَّرَّاجَة and with Quranic tajweed instruction. 1.1 Vocabulary NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR The student should maintain a personal dictionary in a notebook. Set aside a few pages for: Nouns Verbs Adjectives Particles Whenever new vocabulary is given the student should copy the new word and its meaning to his dictionary under the appropriate section. Our first vocabulary list includes many words and the instructor may wish to give them to the student a few at a time. If the students have been given Arabic instruction in pre-school they may already be familiar with many of these words. Here is a word list to memorize. Arabic English وَلَد walad a boy أَسَد asad a lion بَيْت bayt a house كِتَاب kitaab a book قِرْد qird a monkey كَلْب kalb a dog قِطَّة qiṭṭah a cat سَيَّارَة sayyaarah a car دَرَّاجَة darraajah a bike مَسْجِد masjid a masjid تُفَّاحَة tuffaaḥah an apple مَوْزَة mawzah a banana بُرْتُقَالَة burtuqaalah an orange بَيْضَة bayḍah an egg مَدْرَسَة madrasah a school كُرَة kurah a ball قَلَم qalam a pen حَدِيقَة ḥadeeqah a garden NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR In drills, when writing the definite article ال deliberately leave it without tashkeel in order to get the student familiarized with reading it. Also, let the student write Arabic without any tashkeel on the letters. We will later ask him to vowelize only disambiguating letters, e.g. كتبتُ vs كتبتَ.

Here are some examples of verbs: rode ate Here are the verbs in Arabic: Arabic English رَكِبَ he rode أَكَلَ he ate Did you notice that in Arabic the verbs all mean “he” did something? This is because in Arabic the word “he” is part of the verb. If we want to say “she rode” or “I rode” or “You rode” the verb is modified. But we will learn all those later in-shaa-Allaah. For now, we will focus on “he” verbs because they are the easiest. 2.0.1 Sentences with verbs Here is a sentence with a verb: “He rode a bike.” Let’s see how to say this sentence in Arabic. The verb “he rode” is رَكِبَ and the noun “a bike” is دَرَّاجَة. So our sentence is: رَكِبَ الدَّرَّاجَة “He rode a bike.” What if we want to say: “The boy rode the bike”? In this case we still use the verb رَكِبَ “he rode”. But now, when we put the noun الوَلَد next to it, we cross out the “he” in “he rode” and say “the boy rode”. رَكِبَ الوَلَد الدَّرَّاجَة “The boy he rode the bike.” “The boy rode the bike.” Note also that in Arabic the verb usually comes first. Then the person who does the action. And then the other noun. Let’s take a look at a few more examples: “The boy rode a bike.” رَكِبَ الوَلَد درَّاجَة “A boy rode a bike.” رَكِبَ وَلَد درَّاجَة “Zayd rode the bike.” رَكِبَ زَيْد الدَّرَّاجَة 2.1 Vocabulary he rode he ate he drank he wrote he read water milk "],["prepositions.html", "3 Prepositions", " 3 Prepositions Prepositions are words like “to”, “in”, “on”, “from”. Here are some Arabic prepositions Arabic English إِلَىٰ ilaa to فِي fee in عَلَىٰ ɛalaa on مِنْ min from Note that إِلَىٰ and عَلَىٰ end with ىٰ: a yaa with no dots and with a tiny alif on top of it. This is pronounced like an alif. Prepositions come before nouns just like in English. Examples: إِلَىٰ المَسْجِد “to the masjid” فِي بَيْت “in a house” عَلَىٰ كِتَاب “on a book” مِنْ الوَلَد “from the boy” NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR Notice that we are leaving the sukoon on مِنْ even when followed by a همزة وصل. This is so as not to overburden the student. He may pronounce the phrase as min al-walad instead of mina l-walad. Similarly, the student may pronounce ilaa al-masjid and fee al-bayt instead of ila l-masjid and fi l-bayt. We can use prepositions in sentences with verbs as well: ذَهَبَ الوَلَد إلَىٰ البَيْت “The boy went to the house.” "],["adjectives.html", "4 Adjectives", " 4 Adjectives Adjectives are words that describe nouns. Here are some adjectives in English: big small good fast We can describe some nouns using these adjectives: “a big house” “a small cat” “the good boy” “the fast car” Here are the Arabic adjectives: Arabic English كَبِير big صَغِير small حَسَن good سَرِيع fast In English we put the adjective before the noun, but in Arabic we put the adjective after the noun: بَيْت كَبِير “a big house” كَلْب صَغِير “a small dog” However, adjectives are little more complicated in Arabic than in English. In Arabic, if the noun ends with a ة, then a ة is added to the adjective as well. For example, قِطَّة صَغِيرَة “a small cat” When adding a ة, the letter before the ة always gets a fatḥah. Adding ة to the adjective is also done when the noun refers to a girl or a woman, even if the noun does not have a ة. “A mother” in Arabic is أُمّ. If we want to say “a good mother” we will say أُمّ حَسَنَة NOT أُمّ حَسَنَ Another rule for adjectives is that if the noun has ال “the”, then the adjective will also have ال: الوَلَد الحَسَن “the good boy” (We still say in English “the good boy”, not “the good the boy”) Now how about if the noun has both ال and ة? Well, we add both ال and ة to the adjective as well: السَّيَّارَة السَّرِيعَة “the fast car” 4.0.1 Vocabulary big small fast good beautiful mother tree flower "],["multiple-adjectives-and.html", "5 Multiple adjectives, “and” 5.1 Vocabulary", " 5 Multiple adjectives, “and” In English sometimes we can use multiple adjectives to describe the same noun. For example: “the big red apple” We can have multiple adjectives in Arabic as well. We put them both after the noun. التُّفَّاحَة الكَبِيرَة الحَمْرَاء “the big red apple” Sometimes we can put the word “and” between the adjectives: “a fast and small car” The Arabic word for and is وَ. We can use it between adjectives: سَيَّارَة سَرِيعَة وَصَغِيرَة “a fast and small car” Did you notice that وَ “and” is written right next to the second word without any space? This is the rule for writing وَ in Arabic. وَ can be used with nouns and verbs as well. Examples: أَكَلَ زَيْد تُفَّاحَة وَبُرتُقَالَة “Zayd ate an apple and an orange.” أَكَلَ زَيْد الطَّعَام وَشَرِبَ المَاء “Zayd ate the food and he drank the water.” What if we have more than two items? In English we use commas, and write “and” for the last item. “He ate an apple, an orange, and a banana.” In Arabic we don’t use commas between multiple items. Instead we keep putting وَ: أَكَلَ تُفَّاحَة وَبُرْتُقَالَة وَمَوْزَة “He ate an apple, an orange, and a banana.” 5.1 Vocabulary tall short delicious he sat chair desk cold girl man "],["colors.html", "6 Colors", " 6 Colors Colors are adjectives. Just like you can say “a fast car” you can also say “a red car”. Here are some colors in Arabic: Arabic English بُنِّيّ brown بُرْتُقَالِيّ orange بَنَفْسَجِيّ purple وَرْدِيّ pink أَحْمَر red أَخْضَر green أَصْفَر yellow أَزْرَق blue أَسْوَد black أَبْيَض white When using colors to describe nouns, then as we have already learned, if the noun has ال then we add ال to the color as well. Examples: كِتَاب أَحْمَر “a red book” الكِتَاب الأَحْمَر “the red book” قَلَم بُرْتُقَالِيّ “an orange pen” القَلَم البُرْتُقَالِيّ “the orange pen” Did you notice that the words for the colors in Arabic are in two groups: Those that end in ـِيّ : بُنِّيّ بُرْتُقَالِيّ بَنَفْسَجِيّ وَرْدِيّ Those that are all in the same pattern like: أَحْمَر أَخْضَر أَصْفَر أَزْرَق أَسْوَد أَبْيَض Each of these groups is treated differently when using them to describe nouns that end in ة The first group that ends in ـِيّ is treated the same way as we have already studied: If the noun has ة, then we add ة to the adjective as well. For example: زَهْرَة وَرْدِيَّة “a pink flower” السَّيَّارَة البُنِّيَّة “the brown car” For the second group, when the noun ends with ة, then we modify the colors in a different way: أَحْمَر becomes حَمْرَاء أَخْضَر becomes خَضْرَاء أَصْفَر becomes صَفْرَاء أَزْرَق becomes زَرْقَاء أَسْوَد becomes سَوْدَاء أَبْيَض becomes بَيْضَاء Note that they are all modified in the same pattern. So now we can say: زَهْرَة حَمْرَاء “a red flower” السَّيَّارَة الزَّرْقَاء “the blue car” By the way, remember that nouns for girls and women are treated like they have ة even if they don’t actually have ة. For example بِنْت حَمْرَاء “a red girl” "],["verb-conjugations-she.html", "7 Verb conjugations: “she”", " 7 Verb conjugations: “she” We have learned how to say verbs for “he”. Examples: English Arabic he went ذَهَبَ he rode رَكِبَ he ate أَكَلَ If we want to say “I went” or “you went” or “she went” we have to modify the verb. Today we will learn how to say “she” verbs. In-shaa-Allah next time we will kearn how to say “you” and “I” verbs. English Arabic he went ذَهَبَ she went ذَهَبَتْ Examples: ذَهَبَ إِلَى المَسْجِد. “He went to the masjid.” ذَهَبَتْ إِلَى المَسْجِد. “She went to the masjid.” These modifications are the same for all verbs. Example: رَكِبَتْ دَرَّاجَة. “She rode a bike.” Now, remember that if we want to say “Zayd went to the masjid”, then we use the “he went” verb and cross out the “he” ذَهَبَ زَيْد إِلَى المَسْجِد. “Zayd he went to the masjid.” “Zayd went to the masjid.” Similarly, if we want to say “Zaynab went to the masjid”, then we use the “she went” verb and cross out the “she” ذَهَبَتْ زَيْنَب إِلَى المَسْجِد. “Zaynab she went to the masjid.” “Zaynab went to the masjid.” Similarly, أَكَلَتْ الأُمّ الطَّعَام “The mother ate the food.” It Arabic only has verbs for “he” and “she”. It doesn’t have any word for “it”. So if you have sentence in English where an animal or a non-living thing does something, then you check if its noun has a ة. If it does not have ة then we use the “he” verb. If it has a ة then we use the “she” verb. For example if you are talking about a dog and you say “It drank the water.”, you will say: شَرِبَ المَاء. “It drank the water.” and شَرِبَ الكَلْب المَاء. “The dog drank the water.” Similarly, if you are talking about a car and you say “It went to the school.”, you will say: ذَهَبَتْ إِلَى المَدْرَسَة. “It went to the school.” and ذَهَبَتْ السَّيَّارَة إِلَى المَدْرَسَة. “The car went to the school.” NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR I’m not modifying the sukoon in ذَهَبَتْ السيارة to a kasrah: ذَهَبَتِ السيارة. This is so the student does not confuse it with ذَهَبْتِ which we will learn next time in-shaa-Allah. It is ok if the student pronounces dhahabat al-sayyaarah instead of dhahabati l-sayyaarah (or dhahabati s-sayyaarah).

One is for if you are talking to a boy and the other is if you are talking to a girl. So if you say to a boy: “You went to the masjid”, you would say: ذَهَبْتَ إِلَى المَسْجِد. “You(boy) went to the masjid.” However, if you were talking to a girl, you would say: ذَهَبْتِ إِلَى المَسْجِد. “You(girl) went to the masjid.” "],["with-above-and-under.html", "9 “with”, “above”, and “under”", " 9 “with”, “above”, and “under” “with” The word for “with” in Arabic is ب. ب comes before a word and is joined to it.

So then we can say: هَـٰذَا رَجُل “This is a man.” Let’s see now how to say “This is a girl.” When we are talking about a girl, or a noun that has ة we don’t use هَـٰذَا.

For example, ذَهَبْتُ إِلَى المَدْرَسَة مَعَ زَيْد “I went to the school with Zayd.” لَعِبَتْ البِنْت مَعَ زَيْنَب “The girl played with Zaynab.” مَعَ can also be used in a question: مَعَ مَنْ لَعِبْتَ؟ “With whom you played?” = “With whom did you play?” "],["the-possessive-part-i-s.html", "17 The possessive (Part I: ’s)", " 17 The possessive (Part I: ’s) In English we can say “a boy’s book” “the woman’s house” “Zayd’s school” In Arabic we simply place the nouns together but we reverse the order of the two nouns. And only the second noun gets ال for “the”. Here are the Arabic for the above examples: Arabic English كِتَاب-وَلَد “a boy’s book” بَيْت-المَرْأَة “the woman’s house” مَدْرَسَة-زَيْد “Zayd’s school” For now we will put a hyphen “-” between the words which are connected with “’s”. NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR We’re using a hyphen because two nouns can occur next to each other without being a possessive, e.g., رَأَتْ أُمّ وَلَد which, without case endings can be either “A woman saw a boy.”, or “She saw a boy’s mother.” So without introducing case endings we think it will be easier to facilitate recognition of the possessive, at least where there is ambiguity. Also, we we say مَدْرَسَة-زَيْد we will pronounce it madrasat zayd not madrasah zayd. So when translating from Arabic to English, if you see two nouns together with a hyphen “-” between them, you should translate them with (’s). Start with last noun. if it has ال then write “the”. Then go backwards and connect nouns with (’s). سَيَّارَة-الرُّجُل “the man’s car” سَيَّارَة-رَجُل “a man’s car” سَيَّارَة زَيْد “Zayd’s car” By the way we can add more nouns connected with “’s”: مِفْتَاح بَاب بَيْت رَجُل “a man’s house’s door’s key” مِفْتَاح بَاب بَيْت الرَّجُل “the man’s house’s door’s key” Note that ال is added only to the last noun. NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR It may be more idiomatic in English to say “The key of the door of the house of the man”. But it will be hard to explain to the student how the multiple “the’s” in English are translated. And in the next chapter, for simplicity, we will reserve “of” for quantities and materials. "],["the-possessive-part-ii-of.html", "18 The possessive (Part II: of)", " 18 The possessive (Part II: of) In English we can use the word “of” in expressions like: “a cup of water” “the box of cereal” In Arabic we again place the nouns together but now we don’t reverse the order of the two nouns. And again, only the second noun gets ال for “the”. Here are the Arabic for the above examples: Arabic English كُوب-مَاء “a cup of water” عُلْبَة-الحُبُوب “the box of cereal” Note that even the english was “the box of cereal”, in Arabic we will but ال with the last noun: عُلْبَة-الحُبُوب To summarize, in English if you have two nouns connected with “’s” or “of”, in Arabic we write the expression the same way, but the order is different. But in both cases, the ال, if any, is added to the last Arabic word. “’s”: reverse order “of”: keep same order Translating from Arabic to English, sometimes you can use either “’s” or “of”. For example, “the book of the man”, and “the man’s book” mean more or less the same thing. But to make it simple, we will use “of” for quantites (of foods for example) and materials. So we will كِتَاب الرَّجُل as “the man’s book” and keep “of” for “a cup of water” or “a piece of cake” or “the ring of gold” etc. NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR Consider رأسُ رجلٍ كبيرٌ An idiomatic English translation is “the big head of a man”. The “the” is because a man has only one head. But in Arabic رأس is technically indefinite. So inorder to simplify the student, we sacrifice idiom for simplicity and instruct the student to translate as “A man’s big head”. By the way, we’re not teaching adjective’s with idaafah just yet, but we’re thinking ahead and trying to stay simple and consistent. "],["attached-pronouns-for-possessive.html", "19 Attached pronouns for possessive", " 19 Attached pronouns for possessive iIn this chapter we will learn how to say “my”, “your”, “his”, and “her”. In Arabic we express this by attaching a suffix to the last part of the noun. Examples: English Arabic His book كِتَابُهُ Her book كِتَابُهَا Your(boy) book كِتَابُكَ Your(girl) book كِتَابُكِ My book كِتَابِي For now we will put a ḍammah before adding the suffix, except for “my”. For nouns that end with ة, it is converted to a regular ت when adding the suffix. Let’s see how to say these for the noun حَقِيبَة “bag”. English Arabic His bag حَقِيبَتُهُ Her bag حَقِيبَتُهَا Your(boy) bag حَقِيبَتُكَ Your(girl) bag حَقِيبَتُكِ My bag حَقِيبَتِي "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
