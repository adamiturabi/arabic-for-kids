This course aims to teach Arabic to non-native speaking school children.

## Approach {-}

We will focus on basic grammar, vocabulary and comprehension. So for example, we will accept as correct:

[فَتَحَ الوَلَد بَاب وَذَهَبَ إِلَىٰ الحَديقَة]{.ar}  
[fataHa Eal-walad bAb wapahaba EilA Eal-HadIqah]{.trn}

rather than

[فَتَحَ الوَلَدُ بَابًا وَذَهَبَ إِلَى الحَديقَة]{.ar}  
[fataHa l-waladu bAban wapahaba Eila l-HadIqah]{.trn}

The reason for this is that our goal is for children to be able to parse sentences and read and write at a basic proficiency. Although case endings are essential for an in-depth understanding, and indeed for disambiguation from flexible word order ([ضَرَبَ عمرًا زيدٌ]{.ar}), we feel they are not imperative to understand sentences that follow normal word order. At this basic level, we fear that case endings will introduce additional complexity to a non-native speaking student.

Once the student is at a high-school or college level, they may take an [الآجرومية]{.ar} or similar course for a more complete study of the grammar.

We will however try to introduce the concept of inflection to the student. Perhaps the sound masculine plural inflection in the [marfooe]{.trn} vs other cases will be suitable for this since it is one of the more visible inflections in unvowelized text and the student will get accustomed to seeing it in his supplemental reading.

## Starting age {-}

Lesson 1 of this course should be suitable for a child of around 8 years of age.

## Pre-requisites {-}

The student should already know how to read fully vowelized Arabic at a beginner level, i.e., basic [fathah]{.trn}, [kasrah]{.trn}, [Dammah]{.trn}, [caddah]{.trn}, and long vowels. More complicated orthography, like [hamzat al-wasl]{.trn}, is not expected to be known. But it is assumed that the student is getting Quranic [tajwId]{.trn} instruction at the same time elsewhere.

## Instruction and drills {-}

Each lesson is to be instructed to the student with new vocabulary introduced.

This lesson is then reinforced by regular drills. The drills usually require the student to translate a few sentences from Arabic to English and English to Arabic.
