# Introduction {-}

This course aims to teach Arabic to non-native children

## Approach {-}

We will intially focus more on vocabulary, comprehension, and basic grammar rather than formal grammar. So for example, we will accept as correct:

[فَتَحَ الوَلَد بَاب وَذَهَبَ إِلَىٰ الحَديقَة]{.ar}  
[fataHa Eal-walad bAb wapahaba EilA Eal-HadIqah]{.trn}

rather than

[فَتَحَ الوَلَدُ بَابًا وَذَهَبَ إِلَى الحَديقَة]{.ar}  
[fataHa l-waladu bAban wapahaba Eila l-HadIqah]{.trn}

Correct case endings, moods, inflection will be introduced later.

## Starting age {-}

Lesson 1 of this course should be suitable for a child of around 8 years of age.

## Pre-requisites {-}

The student should already know how to read fully vowelized Arabic.

## Instruction and drills {-}

Each lesson is to be instructed to the student with new vocabulary introduced.

This lesson is then reinforced by regular drills. The drills usually require the student to translate a few sentences from Arabic to English and English to Arabic.
