# More questions

We have learned that [مَا]{.ar} "what" and [مَنْ]{.ar} "who" can be used to ask questions.

[مَا هَذَا؟ هَذَا كِتَاب.]{.ar}  
"What is this? This is a book."


[مَنْ هَذِهِ؟ هَذَا مَرْأَة.]{.ar}  
"Who is this? This is a woman."

Arabic also has another word for "what": [مَاذَا]{.ar}. 

[مَاذَا]{.ar} is generally used with verbs instead of [مَا]{.ar}.

[مَاذَا رَكِب؟ رَكِبَ الدَّرَّاجَة]{.ar}  
"What he rode?" = "What did he ride?"  
"He rode the bike."

We can use [مَاذَا]{.ar} with prepositions before it.

[فِي مَاذَا وَضَعْتَ الكِتِاب؟ وَضَعْتُ الكِتَاب في الحَقِيبَة]{.ar}  
"In what you put the book?" = "In what did you put the book?"  
"I put the book in th ebag."

[بِمَاذَا لَعِبَ الوَلَد؟ لَعِبَ الوَلَد بِالكُرَة.]{.ar}  
"With what the boy played?" = "With what did the boy play?"  
"The boy played with the ball."

## [مَعَ]{.ar}

We already learned the word [بِ]{.ar} which means "with".

Arabic has another word [مَعَ]{.ar} which also means "with".

[بِ]{.ar} is generally used if you do something with an object, e.g., you play _with_ a ball, you open a door _with_ a key.

**NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR**

For now, we will not consider usages of the type:

[ذَهَبَ بِالرَّجُل و جَاءَ بِه]{.ar}  
"To take someone or bring someone to ..."
:::

[مَعَ]{.ar} is used when you do something _together with_ someone else. For example,

[ذَهَبْتُ إِلَى المَدْرَسَة مَعَ زَيْد]{.ar}  
"I went to the school with Zayd."

[لَعِبَتْ البِنْت مَعَ زَيْنَب]{.ar}  
"The girl played with Zaynab."

[مَعَ]{.ar} can also be used in a question:

[مَعَ مَنْ لَعِبْتَ؟]{.ar}  
"With whom you played?" = "With whom did you play?"
