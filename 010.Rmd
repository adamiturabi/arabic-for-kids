# Verbs "run" and "see"

Today we will learn two new verbs: "he ran" and "he saw".

The verb "he ran" is [جَرَىٰ]{.ar}. It has a [ىٰ]{.ar} at the end which is pronounced like an [ا]{.ar}, just like in [إِلَىٰ]{.ar} and [عَلَىٰ]{.ar}.

[جَرَىٰ زَيْد فِي الحَدِيقَة.]{.ar}  
"Zayd ran in the garden."

Let's see how to say "she ran", "you ran" and "I ran".

| English | Arabic |
|:--------------------|:--------------|
|he ran           | [جَرَىٰ]{.ar} | 
|she ran          | [جَرَتْ]{.ar} |
|you^(boy)^ ran   | [جَرَيْتَ]{.ar} |
|you^(girl)^ ran  | [جَرَيْتِ]{.ar} |
|I ran            | [جَرَيْتُ]{.ar} |

When we say "she ran" we drop the [ىٰ]{.ar} and say [جَرَتْ]{.ar} [jarat]{.trn}.

[جَرَتْ البِنْتُ في الحَدِيقَة]{.ar}  
"The girl ran in the garden."

And when we say "you ran" and "I ran" the [ىٰ]{.ar} becomes a normal [ي]{.ar} with a sukoon. Example:

[جَرَيْتَ في الحَدِيقَة]{.ar}  
"You ran in the garden."

Another verb just like [جَرَىٰ]{.ar} "he ran" is [رَأَىٰ]{.ar} "he saw"

| English | Arabic |
|:--------------------|:--------------|
|he saw           | [رَأَىٰ]{.ar} | 
|she saw          | [رَأَتْ]{.ar} |
|you^(boy)^ saw   | [رَأَيْتَ]{.ar} |
|you^(girl)^ saw  | [رَأَيْتِ]{.ar} |
|I saw            | [رَأَيْتُ]{.ar} |
