# Detached pronouns, so

## Detached pronouns

In this chapter we will learn how to say pronouns. Here are the pronouns in Arabic.

| English | Arabic |
|:--------|:--------|
|He         |[هُوَ]{.ar} |
|She        |[هِيَ]{.ar} |
|I          |[أَنَا]{.ar} |
|You^(boy)^ |[أَنْتَ]{.ar} |
|You^(girl)^|[أَنْتِ]{.ar} |

"I" [أَنَا]{.ar} is always pronounced [Eana]{.trn} not [EanA]{.trn}

Examples:

## So

The Arabic word for "so" is [فَ]{.ar}. It is always joined to the word after it.

[ذَهَبَ الوَلَد إِلَى ال]

[رَأَىٰ الوَلَد الكُرَة فِي الحَدِيقَة فَلَعِبَ بِالكُرَة]{.ar}  
"Zayd saw the ball in the garden so he played with the ball."

[فَهُوَ]{.ar}
