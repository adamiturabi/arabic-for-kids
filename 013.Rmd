# Nominal sentence

We have learned that Arabic doesn't have a word for "is". So if we want to say "This is a man", we will say,

[هَذِهِ مَرْأَة]{.ar}  
"This is a woman."

We can replace "this" with a noun:

[الأُمّ مَرْأَة]{.ar}  
"The mother is a woman."

We can also use proper nouns:

[زَيْنَب مَرْأَة]{.ar}  
"Zaynab is a woman."

[المَرْأَة زَيْنَب]{.ar}  
"The woman is Zaynab."

Now we will learn how to say sentences with adjectives like "The man is big."

First we write the word for "the man"[الرَّجُل]{.ar}. Then we don't write any word for "is". And, finally, we write the adjective [كَبِير]{.ar} "big" without [ال]{.ar}.

[الرَّجُل كَبِير]{.ar}  
"The man is big."

How about "The woman is big."? Now we will use the adjective [كَبِيرَة]{.ar} with [ة]{.ar}.

[المَرْأَة كَبِيرَة]{.ar}  
"The woman is big."

We can have proper nouns as well:

[زَيْدٌ كَبِير]{.ar}  
"Zayd is big."

[زَيْنَب كَبِيرَة]{.ar}  
"Zaynab is big."

We can also use colors as adjectives:

[الكِتَاب أَحْمَر]{.ar}  
"The book is red."

[الكُرَة حَمْرَاء]{.ar}  
"The ball is red."
