# Verb conjugations: "you"

Last time we learned how to say "I" and "she" verbs, in addition to "he" verbs. Today we will learn how to say "you" verbs.

| English | Arabic |
|:--------------------|:--------------|
|he went           |[ذَهَبَ]{.ar} | 
|she went          | [ذَهَبَتْ]{.ar} |
|I went            | [ذَهَبْتُ]{.ar} |
|you^(boy)^ went   | [ذَهَبْتَ]{.ar} |
|you^(girl)^ went  | [ذَهَبْتِ]{.ar} |

Did you notice that Arabic has two verbs for "you". One is for if you are talking to a boy and the other is if you are talking to a girl.

So if you say to a boy: "You went to the masjid", you would say:

[ذَهَبْتَ إِلَى المَسْجِد.]{.ar}  
"You^(boy)^ went to the masjid."

However, if you were talking to a girl, you would say:

[ذَهَبْتِ إِلَى المَسْجِد.]{.ar}  
"You^(girl)^ went to the masjid."
