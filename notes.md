## Detached pronouns

## iDaafa ('s)

When two or more nouns are together and last noun may have al.

سيارة الرجل
سيارة رجل

start with last noun. if it has al then write "the". Then go backwards and connect nouns with ('s).

the man's car
a man's car

لون سيارة رجل
a man's car's color

if an adjective follows without al the translate with "is [adj]"

سيارة الجل حمراء
hamraa is used because it agrees with sayyaarah.

لون سيارة الرجل احمر
now ahmar because it agrees with lawn

### Note to instructor:

لون ورقة الشجرة would be translated according to our scheme as "the tree's leaf's color". It would be more idiomatic in English to say, "the color of the leaf of the tree". But this will be harder to explain to the student because of the multiple "the"s.

Consider رأسُ رجلٍ كبيرٌ

An idiomatic English translation is "the big head of a man". The "the" is because a man has only one head. But in Arabic رأس is technically indefinite. So inorder to simplify the student, we sacrifice idiom for simplicity and instruct the student to translate as "A man's big head". Btw, we're not teaching adjective's with idaafah just yet, but we're thinking ahead and trying to stay simple and consistent.

## iDaafa (of)

sometimes ('s) doesn't translate well. This is usually when we are talking about foods.

كوب الحليب
a milk's cup

قطعة كعكة
a cake's piece

In this case, still look at the last word. If it has al write "the". else write "a".

then this time, follow the order of 1st word then 2nd word and connect wit "of" not with ('s).

a cup of milk

a piece of cake.


## Attached pronouns

### Only verbs and prepositions first

Used when english uses him, her, me

english as only you, so substitue with he/him to see if anta or ka should be used.

verbs use nee instead of ee.

ila, 3ala, fee become ilayya, etc.

### Nouns:

Arabic does not have my, your, his, her. arabic uses x of me, x of him, x of youu.

so use same attached pronouns.

my: nee only with verbs. nouns have ee.

## Collective nouns

Use hair as an example:

+ a/the hair: one hair
+ hairs: countable, with numeral
+ hair/the hair: substance, material. "brown hair" "cut hair"

piece of paper قطعة ورق
piece of a paper قطعة ورقة
