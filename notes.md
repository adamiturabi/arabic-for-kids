انا سعيدة for a girl

## Attached pronouns

### Only verbs and prepositions first

Used when english uses him, her, me

english as only you, so substitue with he/him to see if anta or ka should be used.

verbs use nee instead of ee.

ila, 3ala, fee become ilayya, etc.

### Nouns:

Arabic does not have my, your, his, her. arabic uses x of me, x of him, x of youu.

so use same attached pronouns.

my: nee only with verbs. nouns have ee.

## Collective nouns

Use hair as an example:

+ a/the hair: one hair
+ hairs: countable, with numeral
+ hair/the hair: substance, material. "brown hair" "cut hair"
