# The possessive 1 ('s)

In English we can say 

+ "a boy's book"
+ "the woman's house"
+ "Zayd's school"

In Arabic we simply place the nouns together but we reverse the order of the two nouns. And only the second noun gets [ال]{.ar} for "the". Here are the Arabic for the above examples:

|Arabic | English |
|:----------|:--------------|
|[كِتَاب-وَلَد]{.ar}   |"a boy's book"       |
|[بَيْت-المَرْأَة]{.ar} |"the woman's house"  |
|[مَدْرَسَة-زَيْد]{.ar}  |"Zayd's school"      |

For now we will put a hyphen "-" between the words which are connected with "'s".

**NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR**
We're using a hyphen because two nouns can occur next to each other without being a possessive, e.g., [رَأَتْ أُمّ وَلَد]{.ar} which, without case endings can be either

+ "A woman saw a boy.", or
+ "She saw a boy's mother."

So without introducing case endings we think it will be easier to facilitate recognition of the possessive, at least where there is ambiguity.

Also, we we say [مَدْرَسَة-زَيْد]{.ar} we will pronounce it [madrasat zayd]{.trn} not [madrasah zayd]{.trn}.

So when translating from Arabic to English, if you see two nouns together with a hyphen "-" between them, you should translate them with ('s).

Start with last noun. if it has [ال]{.ar} then write "the". Then go backwards and connect nouns with ('s).

[سَيَّارَة-الرُّجُل]{.ar}  
"the man's car"

[سَيَّارَة-رَجُل]{.ar}  
"a man's car"
