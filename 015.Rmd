# Yes, no questions

Here are "yes" and "no" in Arabic

| English | Arabic |
|:--------|:---------|
|Yes  |[نَعَمْ]{.ar} |
|No   |[لا]{.ar} |

A "yes-no" question is one whose answer is either "yes" or "no". For example,

+ "Did you open the door?"
+ "Is the book heavy?"

In Arabic it is very easy to form these questions. You take a statement and put the word [هَلْ]{.ar} in front.

Statement:  
[فَتَحْتَ البَاب.]{.ar}  
"You opened the door."

Question:
[هَلْ فَتَحْتَ البَاب.]{.ar}  
"Did you open the door?"

Statement:  
[الكِتَاب ثَقِيل.]{.ar}  
"The book is heavy."

Question:  
[هَلْ الكِتَاب ثَقِيل.]{.ar}  
"Is the book heavy?"

When translating from Arabic to English, first ignore the word [هَلْ]{.ar} and translate with a questioning tone. Then reform the question into better English. For example:

[هَلْ أَنْتَ قَرِيب؟]{.ar}  
"You are near?"  
"Are you near?"

[هَلْ ذَهَبَ إِلَى البَيْت؟]{.ar}  
"He went to the house?"  
"Did he go to the house?"
